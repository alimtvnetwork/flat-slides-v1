# Camera 2026 — Presenter Webcam Spec Pack

> **Audience:** a *blind* AI agent with **zero prior context**. Read this folder
> top-to-bottom and you will be able to re-implement the entire presenter
> camera (webcam overlay) for the Riseup Asia slide-presentation app — every
> phase, every keyboard shortcut, zoom in / zoom out, drag, resize, fullscreen,
> stage-fill, circle/rectangle frame, face auto-framing, and the new
> **squircle background plates** that make the camera look bigger and richer.

This pack is **self-contained**. It quotes real code from the live
implementation so you can reproduce it without reading `src/`. Where the live
code already exists, file paths are given so you can diff.

## What is the "presenter camera"?

While presenting slides, the speaker can overlay their **live webcam** on top of
the deck — like an OBS / Zoom camera bubble — so the audience sees the presenter
and the slides at once. It floats over the 1920×1080 stage, is draggable,
resizable, can go fullscreen or fill the stage, can be a rectangle or a circle,
and can sit on a decorative **squircle background plate** (the images shipped in
[`./assets/`](./assets/)).

It is **presenter-local only**: it is never exported to PPTX, never part of slide
JSON, and never persisted to the deck. It is pure runtime UI driven by
`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.

## Image manifest (`./assets/`)

The user supplied these. They also live in the project at
[`assets/camera-2026/`](../../assets/camera-2026/) (same filenames). To use them
at runtime, import from `src/assets/` or register a Lovable asset pointer — see
[`05-backgrounds-and-shapes.md`](./05-backgrounds-and-shapes.md) §6.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `01-reference-frame-gold-rim.png` | **Reference look.** A squircle camera frame on a dark slide with a gold→ember (red) glowing rim. This is the visual target. |
| `02-squircle-mask-black.png` | **Shape mask.** Solid black squircle silhouette — the exact rounded-superellipse outline used to clip the video / build a CSS mask. |
| `03-squircle-plate-white-shadow.png` | **Background plate (neutral).** White squircle with a soft drop shadow — sits *behind* the camera to enlarge its footprint. |
| `04-squircle-plate-gold-shadow.png` | **Background plate (gold).** Brand-gold squircle with drop shadow — the on-brand variant of the plate. |

> A "squircle" = superellipse, between a circle and a rounded square. It is the
> frame shape the presenter prefers (see reference image). The black mask gives
> you the exact curve; the white/gold plates are the decorative backings.

## Cross-references (existing system specs)

This pack supersedes and consolidates the scattered camera docs. Keep them in sync:

- `spec/21-slides-system/64-presenter-webcam.md` — original phase/size spec (v2).
- `spec/21-slides-system/65-presenter-shortcuts-v5.md` — v5 shortcut additions (`O`, `P`, `[`, `]`).
- `spec/21-slides-system/51-webcam-overlay.md` — early overlay notes.
- `spec/15-research/01-webcam-overlay.md` — prior-art research.
- Memory: `mem://features/webcam-halo-and-stage`.
